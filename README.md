# Thid is my Local repository.

# we start with a local repository and  then we build a local repository on top of it.
# Step 1: Create the local repository   and then create one global repository from this local repository.
# Step  2: Create a global repository   and then    create a local repository from this global repository.
# Step 3: Make changes in the new local repository, commit them to its own branch, and merge these changes into the local repository .
# Step 4: Add some files to the new local repository, commit them and push them into the remote repository (global repository).
# step 5: Merge changes from the local repository to the global repository, so that both repositories are synchronized.
